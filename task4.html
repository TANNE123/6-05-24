      During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s,
      client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when
      the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox
      was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet
      Explorer.[22] In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started
      on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working
      jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were
      implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an
      ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the
      new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin
      implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and
      standard, released in December 2009.
